<p>Created by Carre Perkins and Jules Real as the final project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp 2018.</p>

<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>

<p>Below, you’ll find various graphs we’ve created as part of our final project. These graphs and visualizations make it eaiser to visualize the data quickly and easily.</p>

<h4 id="total-price-of-key-stocks-with-breakdown-by-year">Total Price of Key Stocks With Breakdown by Year</h4>
<p><img src="./Welcome to Project Stock _ Moose_Tornadoes_Final_Project_files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-03_at_8.37.14_PM.png">
A few key stocks were chosen for further inspection. It was found that the price of the stock was usually under a thousand dollars. However, the price of Google stock far oustripped the others. We also broke down the price of the stock to be able to see which year contributed to growths in price.</p>

<h4 id="average-price-of-stock-over-the-years">Average Price of Stock Over the Years</h4>
<p><img src="./Welcome to Project Stock _ Moose_Tornadoes_Final_Project_files/Screen_Shot_2018-06-30_at_12.42.36_PM.png">
The vast majority of stock prices over the years has remained below 500 US$. This is in line with what we have seen from other graphs and visualizations. To invest in a decent company, you should have at least 500$ to start.</p>

<h4 id="lollipop-chart-of-random-selection-of-stocks">Lollipop Chart of Random Selection of Stocks</h4>
<p><img src="./Welcome to Project Stock _ Moose_Tornadoes_Final_Project_files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-04_at_10.20.26_AM.png">
The outlier Google was removed from the dataset. Random stocks were selected to show in a lollipop format the price of each.</p>

<h4 id="accuracy-of-predictions">Accuracy of Predictions</h4>
<p><img src="./Welcome to Project Stock _ Moose_Tornadoes_Final_Project_files/Screen_Shot_2018-07-04_at_2.52.20_PM.png">
Stocks that outperformed fell under the 1. Stocks that underperformed fell under the 0. In conclusion, we found that once we fed the data through the ML, our predictions were only about 67% accurate. Stick to the Apple Stocks app!</p>
